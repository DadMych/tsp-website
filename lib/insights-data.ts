    decision:
      "We made the POS the single source of truth and positioned every integration as 'this makes your existing tools more powerful.' The platform reads from the POS at runtime — it never competes with it. This was both a technical architecture decision AND a stakeholder management decision. Staff didn't have to learn a new catalog system. The platform just worked with what they already knew.",
    outcome:
      "Zero retraining cost. Staff adopted the platform in days — not weeks, not months. Catalog updates in the POS appeared on the platform in near-real-time. We never had a sync complaint.

    explanation:
      "Instead of manually setting up servers by clicking buttons in a dashboard, every server configuration is written as code files. If the server explodes, we run the code and get an identical server back in minutes. It's a recipe book for your entire infrastructure.",

    explanation:
      "An automated assembly line for code. Developer writes code → it gets automatically tested → automatically deployed to a test environment → then to production. No manual uploading, no 'works on my machine' surprises.",

    explanation:
      "A checkpoint that runs before the website even starts loading. Think of it as a bouncer at the door — if you haven't completed onboarding, you don't get in. Doesn't matter which page you try to visit.",

    term: "Webhook Lifecycle",
    explanation:
      "When a payment happens, the payment provider sends a message to our server saying 'hey, money arrived.' The webhook lifecycle is everything we do with that message: verify it's real, transform it into our format, handle failures, and update the order. If any step fails, the whole thing retries safely.",

    explanation:
      "Three different toolkits for building user interfaces. Tailwind gives you full creative control (used for what members see). Ant Design comes with pre-built data tables and forms (used for staff dashboards). Material UI has specific interactive components (used for admin tools). Different jobs, different tools.",
